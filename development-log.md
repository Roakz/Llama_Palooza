<h1>Development Log</h1>

**04/09/2019**<br><br>
As we approach the halfway mark on the development of llama Palooza i felt it was time to make a log entry and report in on how i am going and a few things i have learnt. There are also a couple of things i feel i will do better next time as a result of my progress so far.<br><br>

I am from an overall perspective happy with my progress so far. Thanks to a bit of guidance from matt i feel im on the right track to developing an AGILE program that will easily be able to be tailored into other things in the future. The script is also much DRY-er than i feel it would have originally been. The reason for this is that as my understanding of how to write methods, into the classes within the app, has developed i have been able to dramatically increase my success in this area.<br><br>

My main concern is that although i have been constantly testing everything as i progress i feel that from a profesional development point of view a more formal style of TDD should be employed in th future. My app will come with all the approproate tests however they should have been written before hand. The limitation here was my level of competence and understanding of how to efficiently write the classes and mehtods. In the future i feel i will be better preopared to do this.
