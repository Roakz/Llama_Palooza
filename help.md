<h1> Welcome to the Help File</h1>

The only real requirements here are that you have a terminal running the latest version of Ruby. Then the correct Gems should be installed for the app to run as it should.

<h2>Ruby & WSL</h2>

If you dont already have ruby installed it is really simple to do. Go this link https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/ and follow the prompts for you appropriate terminal.If you run windows you will need to install a WSL also known as a windows subsystem. I run Ubuntu on windows and wrote a blog about WSL's and installing Ubuntu. Check it out at this link if you need help. https://medium.com/thelearningcurve/how-to-code-from-windows-dramatic-music-ba-ba-baaaam-awkward-silence-d7dee80088d2 <br><br>

<h2>Gems</h2>

The gems used for this project are Artii, Rainbow and Test-unit. <Br><br>

* Artii converts the headings to an ascii style text heading.
* Rainbow provides the colours for the text.
* Test-unit is used for running the unit test to drive TDD (Test driven development).

This repository contains a gemfile with the gems needed to run Llama Palooza. More information about how to use bundler and activate the gem file to install the correct dependancies go to this link. https://bundler.io/v2.0/guides/using_bundler_in_applications.html<br><br>

**Gems**<br>
A gem is a collection of Ruby code that we can extract into a “collection” which we can call later.<br><br>

**Gem File**<br>
A Gemfile is a file we create which is used for describing gem dependencies for Ruby programs.<br><br> 

**Bundler**<br>
Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.
